"I think it's absolutely mindless, mindless, that they are unwilling to do it. I don't get it. I don't get it."
The former vice president also accused Trump of "already trying to undermine the election with false claims of voter fraud."

Bidenreferenced a report by The Washington Post that the Trump administration was considering leveraging an emergency coronavirus loan from Congress, which needs to be approved by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to force changes at the US Postal Service. The move could allow the administration to influence how much the agency charges for delivering packages and how it manages its finances, according to the Post.
"Imagine threatening not to fund the post office," Biden said. "Now what in God's name is that about? Other than trying to let the word out that he's going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote. That's the only way he thinks he can possibly win."
"You can be assured between (Trump) and the Russians there is going to be an attempt to interfere" in the election, Biden said.
